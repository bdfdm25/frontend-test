# frontend-test

Create a web application called **Marvel Hero Comics List**. The application should show a list of heroes and be able to filter them by name. Choosing a hero should display the newest 5 comics.

## Working with Marvel API
- Register at [Marvel Developers](https://developer.marvel.com/) to get an api access key
- After registering you can check the api docs [here](https://developer.marvel.com/docs). 
- We will be using the following apis (GET)
  - /v1/public/characters
  - /v1/public/characters/{characterId}/comics
- The filters needed are all in the api documentation

## Hints
You could use Material UI, Bootstrap or any other toolkit to accelerate your resolution.

## Requirements
Use **Angular2+** to build the application. Also, briefly elaborate on your solution architecture details, choice of patterns and frameworks. Fork this repository and submit your code.
